# Anonymous Question-Answering System using Blockchain

This is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the blockchain network that enables users to ask any question anonymously to anyone and receive answers from a those users.

The system is designed to ensure that users can ask any question without fear of judgment or persecution. The use of blockchain technology provides a secure and transparent platform that ensures the privacy and anonymity of users.

## How it Works?

1. User registration - Users can register on the platform with a username if they wish to create an account for getting all the questions using their blockchain wallet address.

2. Asking Questions - Users can post any question on the platform anonymously for user accounts of their choice. The question will be stored on the blockchain network and shared with the community of users.

3. Answering Questions - Users can provide answers to the questions they recieved. The answers are also stored on the blockchain network and can be viewed by other users.

## To do:

1. Implement functionality for adding anonymous reactions to the qusetion-answer pair.


## Technology Stack

The application is built on the following technology stack:

1. Solidity - a smart contract programming language for the Ethereum blockchain
2. Remix - a development IDE for Ethereum-based DApps
3. NextJS - a frontend JavaScript framework based on React for building user interfaces
4. Ethers.js - a JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started with Development 

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
